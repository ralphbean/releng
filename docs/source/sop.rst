Fedora Release Engineering Standard Operating Procedures
========================================================

This page documents the Standard Operating Procedures for Fedora Release
Engineering.

Purpose
=======
The SOP section contains a list of tasks Fedora Release Engineering team
provides for the project.  Current Fedora Release Engineering team members
would can add tasks they know about and list steps to complete the task as
well as issues to consider.  This is a great way to make sure that individuals
aren't the only ones that can fix a problem.

The Community
=============
The SOP section is left in the public because it is our hope that others in the
community will add common problems, fix our steps and just in general look over
what we're doing and help us when we're doing something stupid. We encourage
anyone interested to go over our processes with a fine tooth comb. It'll make
us better and we'll probably learn something in the process. Therefore please
open a `pull request`_ to suggest improvements.


Procedures
==========

Needed:
#. Composing an official release
#. Making a composed release publicly available
